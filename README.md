# galaxy-sample-games

Sample games used for testing Galaxy navigator.game API. Only button_test.html actually interfaces with the API at the moment.

Type ``npm start`` to run, go to http://0.0.0.0:1337/static/button_test.html to run the test page. (Other games are included in here, but may or may not actually interface with navigator.game.

WIP - progress paused until v1.

TODO:
1. Implement API usage into all sample games
2. Remove some extra modules from the copy/pasted galaxy-api server
3. Install some of the libraries globally and remove them from here
